📄 Description – Exercise Statement

This project contains three Java programming exercises focused on object-oriented concepts and class structure:

Exercise 1 – Musical Instruments

Modeling a class hierarchy for musical instruments. It includes an abstract class with a play() method, and specific subclasses (wind, string, and percussion instruments). It also demonstrates the use of initialization blocks and static blocks in Java.

Exercise 2 – Car Class

Creation of a class with the attributes static, final, and static final. It demonstrates the difference between them and includes both a static method (brake()) and a non-static method (accelerate()).

Exercise 1 (Level 2) – Smartphone with Interfaces

Creation of a class hierarchy where a class Smartphone extends Phone and implements two interfaces: Camera and Clock. Methods used include call(), photograph(), and alarm().
